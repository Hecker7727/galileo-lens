## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Change Animation Speed
```tsx
// Faster
transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}

// Slower
transition={{ duration: 1 }}
```

### Change Background Style
In `App.tsx`, line with SpaceBackground:
```tsx
// Try different variants:
<SpaceBackground variant="orbs" />     // Floating orbs
<SpaceBackground variant="gradient" /> // Gradient wash
<SpaceBackground variant="minimal" />  // Subtle (current)
```

### Adjust Counter Speed
In `HomePage.tsx`, AnimatedCounter component:
```tsx
<AnimatedCounter 
  value={608} 
  duration={3}  // Change from 2 to 3 seconds
/>
```
