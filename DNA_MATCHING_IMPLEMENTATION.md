## 📊 Algorithm Details

### DNA Fingerprint Generation

```typescript
function generateFingerprint(dnaData):
  1. Combine all components into string

  4. Return unique 16-character fingerprint
```

### Compatibility Scoring

```typescript
function calculateCompatibility(dna1, dna2):
  1. Find shared methodology (max 30 points)
     score += (shared / max) * 30
  
  2. Find shared organisms (max 25 points)
     score += (shared / max) * 25
  
  3. Find shared stressors (max 25 points)
     score += (shared / max) * 25
  
  4. Find shared outcomes (max 20 points)
     score += (shared / max) * 20
  
  5. Return total score (0-100)
```
