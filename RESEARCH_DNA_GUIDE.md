# 🧬 Research DNA Matching - User Guide

## Overview

The **Research DNA Matching** system is a groundbreaking feature that treats each research publication like it has a unique genetic code. Just like DNA matching in biology, we analyze the "genes" of research papers to find compatible studies!

## 🔍 How DNA Matching Works

### 1. **Generate DNA Fingerprint**
When you select a publication, our AI analyzes it to extract:
- All methodologies used
- Organisms studied
- Stressors applied
- Outcomes measured
- Study characteristics

This creates a unique **16-character DNA fingerprint** (like: `ATGCATGCATGCATGC`)

### 2. **Calculate Compatibility**
We compare your selected publication with others using:

**Compatibility Score Formula (0-100%):**
- **Methodology Overlap**: 30 points max
- **Organism Similarity**: 25 points max
- **Stressor Overlap**: 25 points max
- **Outcome Similarity**: 20 points max

### 3. **Compatibility Levels**

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **80-100%** | 🧬 Highly Compatible | Very similar research DNA - Perfect for cross-validation |
| **60-79%** | ✅ Good Match | Significant overlap - Studies complement each other |
| **40-59%** | 🔄 Moderate Match | Some shared elements - Different perspectives |
| **20-39%** | 🌟 Partial Match | Different directions - May offer unique insights |
| **0-19%** | 🔬 Low Match | Very different research DNA - Distinct areas |
